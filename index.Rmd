#### Hello!!

My name is Randi Bolt and I am currently a junior studying statistics at Portland State University. I began this site at the end of Spring term 2021 to post the various projects and assignments I worked on this term in Statistics 363 : Introduction to R. I will be posting other personal projects and discoveries here as well. Check out the about page for more information on each tab.

Note : This site is currently under construction. Some pages may have blank spots or be empty all together. I will update this message once the site is _finalized_.
