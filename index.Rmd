#### Hello!!

My name is Randi Bolt, and I began this site at the end of Spring term 2021 to post the various projects and assignments I worked on in Statistics 363 : Introduction to R at Portland State University. Check out the about page for more information on each tab, and the contact page for my email and links to other projects. 

Thanks for stopping by, and please enjoy :D
